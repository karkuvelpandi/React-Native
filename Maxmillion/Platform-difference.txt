List of difference need to take care.
IOS vs android

1. Styles: Shadow
On IOS:
 element:{
    shadowColor:"black",
    shadowOffset:{width:0,height:1},
    shadowOpacity:0.8,
    shadowRadius:1,
 }
On android:
 element:{
    elevation:4,
 }

2. Styles: Border radius is not supported directly on a <Text> element in
   React Native. Instead we need to wrap the <Text> with <View> and apply the 
   same style we want

   <Text style={{borderRadius:10}}>Example text</Text>
   The above statement will work fine in android not in IOS. As a work around
   we can wrap a view and style accordingly as below.
   
   <View style={{borderRadius:10}}>
     <Text> Example text </Text>
   </View>
  
  **Important note here is the parent style like color will not applied to child if we 
  given to parent just like the CSS. It will not cascade as its a javascript objects specific
  to that particular elements
